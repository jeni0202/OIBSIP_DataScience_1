# OIBSIP_DataScience_Iris flower classification
🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
📌 Objective

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into one of three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their physical measurements.

🧠 Problem Description

The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Using these features, a machine learning algorithm is trained to identify the species of a given iris flower.
